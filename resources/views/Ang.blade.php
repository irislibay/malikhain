                                <h2>Life of Ang Kiukok</h2>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Ang Kiukok, an ethnic Chinese painter who studied under Vincente Manansala, attained prominence for an Expressionist style that fused Cubist, Surrealist and Expressionist aspects into a unique personal aesthetic. It has been said that he “opened eyes with his violent Cubist paintings of fighting cocks, stray dogs and tormented lovers,” and that his Expresionist works “sustained a hard-edged evocation of fortitude and indignation in a hostile setting of screaming men, crucifixions and junk.”
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    He was an only son with five sisters, born to Chinese immigrants from Fukien; Vicente Ang and Chin Lim. Worried about China’s fate against the invading Manchurians at that time, his father named him Kiukok, which means “save the country.”
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    As a young man, Kiukok did comical sketches and also studied Chinese ink and brush painting methods. Kiukok also copied movie ads from newspapers while tending his father’s sari-sari store, a business that he was expected to someday run. Against his father’s wishes, Kiukok began his formal art studies at Manila’s University of Santo Tomas where Vicente Manansala was his primary mentor, and also became a lifelong friend. At the conclusion of his studies, Kiukok taught art in a school of overseas Chinese for five years.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Kiukok’s first formal recognition came in the form of a third prize award in the Shell National Students Art Competition for Calesa in 1953. Then, at the urging of Vicente Manansala, Kiukok launched his first one-man show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery in 1954.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    In 1965 he and Vicente Manansala traveled to New York. Upon his return to the Philippines, his style took a turn towards a new vivid Expressionist that including themes of agony, sorrow and madness. The difficulty of these themes caused a temporary loss of interest on the part of art dealers and collectors.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    During the Marcos Regime, and the period of martial law in the Philippines, Kiukok returned to painting violent and gruesome imagery that some interpreted as a commentary on the political atmosphere of the era. Once, when asked about the anger in his art he replied “Look around you. So much anger, ugliness. And also madness.”
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Towards the end of his life Ang Kiukok became internationally known. His works are displayed in various collections, such as the Philippine National Museum, the Ateneo Art Gallery, the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Historical Commission in Taipei. In 2001 President Gloria Macapaganal-Arroyo named him a National Artist for visual arts.
