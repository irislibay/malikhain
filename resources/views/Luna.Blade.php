                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    Born in the town of Badoc, Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines, Juan N. Luna was the third among the seven children of Joaquín Luna de San Pedro y Posadas and Laureana Novicio y Ancheta. In 1861, the Luna family moved to Manila and he went to Ateneo Municipal de Manila where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree. He excelled in painting and drawing, and was influenced by his brother, Manuel N. Luna, who, according to Filipino patriot José Rizal, was a better painter than Juan himself.

                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    In 1877 Manuel and Juan Luna traveled to Europe, where Manuel studied music and Juan painting. Juan entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he befriended the painter Don Alejo Vera. Vera brought him to Rome for some of his commissions, and Luna was exposed to the art of the Renaissance painters.

                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    He moved to Paris in 1885 where he opened his own studio and befriended Hidalgo. A year after, he finished the piece El pacto de sangre (The Blood Compact) in accordance with the agreement he had with the Ayuntamiento of Manila. It is now displayed in the Malacañan Palace. Luna's paintings are generally described as being vigorous and dramatic. With its elements of Romanticism, his style shows the influence of Delacroix, Rembrandt, and Daumier.

                                <p class="text-justify">
                                    On December 4, 1886, Luna married María de la Paz Pardo de Tavera, a sister of his friend Felix and Trinidad Pardo de Tavera. They had one son, whom they named Andrés, and a daughter, Maria de la Paz, nicknamed Bibi, who died when she was three years old. Luna was fond of his wife. However, the jealous Luna frequently accused Paz of having an affair with a certain Monsieur Dussaq. Finally in a fit of jealousy, he shot the door wherein his wife was behind. Killing his wife and mother-in-law and wounded his brother-in-law, Felix in the process, on September 22, 1892. He was arrested and murder charges were filed against him. Luna was acquitted of charges on February 8, 1893, on the grounds of a crime of passion. Temporary insanity; the "unwritten law" at the time forgave men for killing unfaithful wives.

                                    On September 16, 1896, he and his brother Antonio Luna were arrested by Spanish authorities for being involved with the Katipunan rebel army. Despite his imprisonment, Luna was still able to produce a work of art which he gave to a visiting priest. In 1898, he was appointed by the executive board of the Philippine revolutionary government as a member of the Paris delegation which was working for the diplomatic recognition of the República Filipina (Philippine Republic). In 1899, upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1898),Luna was named a member of the delegation to Washington, D.C. to press for the recognition of the Philippine government.

                                    He traveled to Hong Kong and died there on December 7, 1899 from a heart attack. His remains were buried in Hong Kong and in 1920 were exhumed and kept in Andrés Luna's house, to be later transferred to a niche at the Crypt of San Agustin Church in the Philippines. Five years later, Juan would be reinstated as a world-renowned artist and Peuple et Rois, his last major work, was acclaimed as the best entry to the Saint Louis World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. Some of his paintings were destroyed by fire in World War II.
